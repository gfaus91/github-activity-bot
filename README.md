# 🟢 github-activity-bot

A tiny bot that commits every day — for fun, automation, and green squares.  
Powered entirely by **GitHub Actions**, with zero servers, zero cron jobs on my side, and zero human effort.

This repository is intentionally simple: it's a small experiment to demonstrate  
**scheduled automation, CI/CD workflows, and GitHub Actions cron triggers.**

---

## 🚀 What does it actually do?

Every day at **07:00 UTC**, a GitHub Action runs and:

1. Updates `activity.log` with the current timestamp  
2. Commits the change using a bot  
3. Pushes it back to the repository  
4. Paints one nice green square on the contributions graph  

That’s it.  
A lightweight showcase of automation and workflow orchestration.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Demonstrated

- **GitHub Actions**
- **CRON-based scheduled workflows**
- Automatic commits with `git-auto-commit-action`
- Repo automation without local scripts
- Zero-infrastructure CI/CD

This is not meant to represent manual coding work —  
just a playful DevOps exercise showing how far automation can go.

## 🤖 Why do this?

Because automation is fun.  
Because GitHub’s green squares are dopamine.  
Because sometimes the simplest projects teach the clearest lessons.

And, honestly:  
If you can automate it, why wouldn’t you?

## 👀 If you actually reached this section…

Congratulations — you’ve officially **broken the fourth wall** of this repo.

Yes, the green squares are generated by a robot.  
No, I'm not pretending it's manual activity.  
The point is not to fake work — it’s to show that I can make a machine do it. 😄

Welcome to the matrix.
